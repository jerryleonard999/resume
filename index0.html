      <h2>Career Summary</h2>
      <p>I have 20+ years of hands-on experience in the semiconductor and optics industries as a Process Development Engineer, Sustaining Engineer, Applications Engineer, Research Scientist and Program Manager.</p>
      <p>I have developed and optimized processes for applications including micro-electronic, micro-mechanical, micro-optical and Diffractive Optical Element devices
      (computer generated holograms). This experience includes work supporting high-volume silicon production lines as well as research and development on novel
      substrates, including gallium arsenide and mercury cadmium telluride (IR focal plane arrays). I have also developed, optimized and patented processes for silicon-based micro-electro-mechanical (MEMs) devices.
      In addition to extensive hands-on experience with numerous micro-fabrication techniques, I have decades of expertise in taking complex and innovative projects
      from conception to prototype production as a process engineer and program manager.</p>

      <p>Fabrication expertise includes photolithography (both thick-film photoresist & high-resolution photoresist, from DUV and i-line scanners and steppers (ASML and
      Nikon) to i-line contact printing), electron microscopy, metal deposition processes (Au-plating, thermal and e-beam evaporation), and metal lift-off processing.

      <p><h2><b>Work Experience</b></h2>
        <ul>

        <li>
        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Senior Process Development Engineer</h3>
        <h4 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Broadcom, Inc. (Charlotte, NC: Digital Optics Corporation sold this site to FLIR in 2013, who then sold it to Broadcom in 2016)
        </h4>
        <p style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">May, 2001 - September 2021</p>

        <p>Engaged as a process development engineer and program manager in the
        manufacture of state-of-the-art Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) for a wide variety of industrial, medical and commercial applications.
        <ul>
          <li>
          <p>Activities include developing new devices (working closely with product, etch, design and test engineers) as well as supporting prototype production in existing
        product lines (quantifying process window capabilities, establishing design rules and SPC procedures and measurement techniques, creating and maintaining work
        flows and engaging in yield enhancement activities).</p></li>
        <li><p>Hands-on activities included developing and optimizing custom photolithographic processes (working closely in a dynamic team environment with etch, test and
        design engineers) using an ASML DUV scanner (tool owner) and Nikon stepper (i-line). I also engaged in extensive SEM analysis of patterned wafers and finished
        devices for process development, process capability determination, yield enhancement and failure analysis.</p></li>
        <li><p>Projects included successfully developing and transitioning a new process for fabricating a computer-generated holographic device from the development stage
        (using a 193nm ASML Step and Scan photolithographic system at NC State) to prototype production at Digital Optics. As part of this effort, I oversaw the
        installation and integration of an ASML DUV 1150C Step and Scan photolithographic capability into an existing product line, as both tool owner and
        lead process engineer for the project. This new process enabled a class of higher performing optical elements which was not only more profitable for Digital Optics
        but also provided increased performance levels for our customers' product base as Broadcom, Inc. This novel process, which is now in production, was developed and implemented in a very cost-effective and timely manner. It has provided entry into new markets for
        Broadcom/Digital Optics Corporation.</p></li>
        <li>Tool owner responsibilities include an ASML 1150C DUV Step and Scan system, TEL ACT8 Track and Hitachi 4160 electron microscope.</p></li>
        <li><p>I have also been engaged in a variety of program management activities at Broadcom/Digital Optics.</li>

        <h3 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Sr. Applications Engineer (Imaging Specialist)</h3>
        <h4 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">ASM Lithography (Austin/Dallas, Tx)</h4>
        <p style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">March 1998 to May 2001</p><br>

        Responsible for supporting and assisting customers in Austin and Dallas, TX in maintaining state-of-the-art sub-micron imaging, overlay and productivity performance in photolithography on ASML wafer steppers and scanners.
        I leveraged my extensive process development and equipment experience to improve yield, productivity and process reliability for ASML customers. I also supported regional sales management in working with customers to identify and specify proper tools to meet imaging goals and requirements. Special training included Imaging Core-Competency: served as Imaging Competency Engineer for the Austin/Dallas region. I took 3 courses in DUV and low k image theory and aberrations training at IMEC in Belgium and was trained in ASML's ARTEMIS project for measuring lens aberrations.
